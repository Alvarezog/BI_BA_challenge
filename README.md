# BI_BA_challenge

Hi! Thank you for reviewing my challenge solution. In this readme, you can find the location of all the answers and supporting information. Feel free to contact me if there are any questions.

## Solution

1. The answers to the first three questions can be found in the `Business Intelligence Challenge.pdf` file included in this repository.

2. Before solving the fourth question of the challenge, it was necessary to create a random date generator script in Python to replace the dates of the original CSV file that were not useful for this analysis. The script is stored in this repository as `random_date_generator.ipynb`. The output of the script is the new csv file named `businessBIBA_challenge_dates.csv`.

3. Using this new file I generated a series of queries to obtain the most valuable insights from the data. You can find the SQL scripts in the file `main_query.sql`. The SQL script outputs several excel files that were used for plotting. The output files were also included in this repository.

4. Plotting of the KPIs and answers to the fourth section of the challenge can be found in the following Tableau dashboard:
